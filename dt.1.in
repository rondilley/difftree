.SH EXAMPLES
You can use difftree to compare two or more directory trees or you can save how a directory tree looks and compare the current state of the directory tree to a previous saved file.

dt -m -w cvs_dir.txt ~/cvs

This command will process the ~/cvs directory tree and store the metadata in cvs_dir.txt.  That file can now be compared with other difftree files or directories.

dt -m cvs_dir.txt ~/cvs

You can compare more than two files and directories at the same time.  They will be compared left to right.

dt -m cvs_dir.txt ~/cvs1 ~/cvs2 ~/cvs3 ~/cvs4

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
\fldt\fP returns 0 on normal program termination and 1 on error.  Additional diagnostic information is available through the \-d command line switch.

.SH SIGNALS
.TP
.B \flSIGHUP\fP will cause \fldt\fP to close the current logfile, then start a new logfile.
